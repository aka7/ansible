#Ansible + CIS Benchmarks + RHEL/CentOS 6

Starting a ansible audit for CIS.
This is an ansible playbook for auditing a system running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or CentOS 6  to see if it passes CIS Security Benchmarks.

Insipired by https://github.com/major/cis-rhel-ansible but instead of applying the changes, this will just report if a system passes or fails for each task.

In progress, code will appear here soon

- Added section 1 level1 and level2 checks
