#Ansible + CIS Benchmarks + RHEL/CentOS 6


This is an ansible playbook for auditing a system running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or CentOS 6  to see if it passes CIS Security Benchmarks.

Insipired by https://github.com/major/cis-rhel-ansible but instead of applying the changesm, this will just report if a system passes or fails fro each task. This was requirement for one of my clients.

In progress.
